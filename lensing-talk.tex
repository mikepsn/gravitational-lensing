\begin{frame}{The Lens Equation}
    The angular deflection $\alpha$ of a gravitational lense is given by
    \begin{equation}    
        \alpha = \frac{4GM}{c^2 \xi}
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $M = $ mass of the deflecting object
        \item $G = $ gravitational constant
        \item $c = $ speed of light
        \item $\xi = $ impact radius of the incoming photon
        \item $\alpha = $ deflection angle
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/gldiag.eps}
    \end{center}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Deflecting Mass}  
    The deflecting mass may be viewed as an optical thin lens, made up
    of a two dimensional mass distribution.
    \begin{equation}
        M = \int_{R^2} \Sigma(\vec{\xi '}) 
            \frac{\vec{\xi} - \vec{\xi '} }{|\vec{\xi} - \vec{\xi '}|^2} d^2 \xi '
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Sigma = $ surface density
        \item $R^2 = $ surface area
    \end{itemize}
    If the deflecting mass, is perfectly symmetric, the deflection angle becomes
    \begin{equation}
        \vec{\alpha} = \frac{4GM(<\xi)\vec{\xi}}{c^2|\vec{\xi}|^2}
    \end{equation}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{The Lens Equation} 
    The lens equation is
    \begin{equation}
        \psi D_{os} + \alpha D_{ds} = \beta D_{os}
    \end{equation}
    It is often the case in many gravitational lensing problems that 
    the images form do not depend on the distances between source, observer
    and deflector directly. Rather a specific ratio of these distances
    is the quantity which needs to be considered. This is known as the
    effective distance $D$ and is defined as:
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:effd}
        D = \frac{D_{od} D_{ds} }{D_{os}}
    \end{equation}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Setup for the Gravitational Lens Equation} 
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[angle=-90,width=0.8\textwidth]{images/setup.eps}
    \end{center}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Einstein Ring} 
    If a distant star is in perfect alignment with a point mass gravitational
    lens and an observer, the light from the distant star is lensed 
    perfectly symmetrically forming a ring image of the star known as an
    Einstein ring. The radius of the Einstein ring is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \theta_{E} = \sqrt{\frac{4GM}{c^2} \frac{D_{ds}}{D_{od} D_{os}}}
    \end{equation}
    If however there isn't a perfect alignment, for a point mass two
    images are produced for each point on the source plane. 
    The angular positions at which these images is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        \theta_{\pm} = \frac{\xi}{D_{od}}
                 = \frac{\beta}{2} \pm \sqrt{\beta^2 + 4\theta^{2}_{E}}
    \end{equation}
    where $\beta$ is the angular position of the source as shown in figure 3.
    The magnification of each of the images is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \mu_{\pm} = \frac{1}{4} 
                \left[ 
                    \frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2 + 4}} 
                    +
                    \frac{\sqrt{y^2 + 4}}{y} 
                    \pm 2
                \right]
    \end{equation}
    where the source and image angles have been scaled such that 
    $y = \psi / \alpha_0$ and $x = \alpha / \alpha_0$.
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Reformulating the Lens Equation} 
Using this notation the lens equation can be rewritten as the scaled
lens equation given by
\begin{equation}
    \vec{y} = \vec{x} - \vec{\alpha}(\vec{x}).
\end{equation}
The vector notation used represents the coordinate in a cartesian plane.
Therefore
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\vec{y} = (y_1, y_2)$ is a coordinate in the source plane and
    \item $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2)$ is a coordinate in the deflecting plane.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Complex Notation}  
This can also be written using complex number notation. A position in 
deflecting plane can be denoted as $z = x_1 + ix_2$, and a position in the
source plane as $z_s = y_1 + iy_2$.

The magnification is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \mu(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{det A(\vec{x})}
\end{equation}
where $det A(\vec{x})$ is the Jacobian determinant of the Hessian matrix
given by
\begin{equation}
    A(\vec{x}) = \frac{\partial \vec{y}}{\partial \vec{x}}
\end{equation}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Critical Curves and Caustics}
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Critical curves are the set of all points in the deflection plane where $A(\vec{x}) = 0$. 
    \item The corresponding curves in the source plane (obtained from the lens equation) are known as caustics.    \item Critical curves are where the gravitational lens infinitely magnifies the light passing through
          that point. 
    \item Source plane caustics are the pre-image of the critical curves.
    \item Any light emitted near a caustic will be greatly magnified as it passes through the lens. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{The Chang-Refsdal Lens}
The Chang-Refsdal lens model describes gravitational lensing using a modification
of the point mass model. This model says that when a source crosses a fold caustic
the lensing is due to a point mass but with an additional external shear applied.
The corresponding lens equation for the Chang-Refsdal model is:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{y} = \left[
                \begin{array}{cc}
                    1 + \gamma & 0   \\
                    0          & 1 - \gamma
                \end{array} 
              \right] \vec{x} - \frac{\vec{x}}{|\vec{x}|^2}
\end{equation}
This can also be written in the complex notation as 
$z_s = z + \gamma \bar{z} - \frac{\epsilon}{\bar{z}}$, where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\gamma$ is a constant determining the amount shear.
    \item $\epsilon = (\frac{\kappa_s}{1 - \kappa_c})$, where $\kappa_s$ is
          the density of compact objects such as stars and $\kappa_c$ is the
          surface density of continuously distributed matter.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

%\end{multicols}

\begin{frame}{The Effects of Distance on Gravitational Lensing}
The Dyer-Roeder equation is given by:
\begin{equation}
    (z+1)(\Omega z + 1) \frac{d^2D}{dz^2} + 
    \left( \frac{7}{2}\Omega z + \frac{1}{2}\Omega + 3 \right) \frac{dD}{dz} + 
    \frac{3}{2} \tilde{\alpha} \Omega D = 0
\end{equation}
This relates the angular diameter distance of a lensing system with the
redshift $z$ of the source object.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Omega$ is the ratio of the mean mass density to the critical
          density of the universe and
    \item $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the clumpiness parameter, which determines
          the amount of matter between the source and the observer.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Initial Conditions for Dyer-Roeder Equation} 
The initial conditions of the Dyer-Roeder equation are:
\begin{equation}
    D_{ii} = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \left[ \frac{dD_{ij}}{dz} \right]_{z_j = z_i} =
         \frac{\mathrm{sgn} (z_j - z_i)}{(z_i + 1)^2 \sqrt{\Omega z_i + 1} }
\end{equation}

The Dyer-Roeder equation needs to be solved for three different cases.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  $\Omega = 0$ $(D_{I})$
    \item  $\Omega = 1$, $\tilde{\alpha} = 1$ $(D_{II})$
    \item  $\Omega = 1$, $\tilde{\alpha} = 0$ $(D_{III})$
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Solving the Dyer-Roeder Equation} 
This leads to three different equations which need to be solved.
\begin{equation}
    (z+1)\frac{d^2D}{dz^2} + 3 \frac{dD}{dz} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    (z+1)^2 \frac{d^2D}{dz^2} + \frac{7}{2}(z+1)\frac{dD}{dz} + \frac{3}{2}D = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    (z+1)^2 \frac{d^2D}{dz^2} + \frac{7}{2}(z+1)\frac{dD}{dz} = 0
\end{equation}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Computational Solution to the Dyer-Roeder Equation} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item A FORTRAN program was written
to numerically solve these equations. 
\item The algorithm used to solve these
equation numerically was the \emph{Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"{o}m}
method.  
\item This method is a fourth order algorithm which is a general form 
of the standard \emph{Runge-Kutta} method, used for solving second order 
ordinary differential equations.
\item The equations were integrated from $z = 0$ to $z = 10$. 
\item The dimming factor $(D_{II}/D_{III})^2$ was determined and plotted
as a function of redshift $z$.
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Solutions to the Dyer-Roeder Equation} 
We solve the Dyer-Roeder
equation for the three different cosmologies resulting in three
solutions for the angular diameter distance $D$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $D_{I}$   \texttt{d1.dat} (The top curve)
    \item $D_{II}$  \texttt{d2.dat} (The bottom curve)
    \item $D_{III}$ \texttt{d3.dat} (The centre curve)
\end{itemize}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{results/cosmo_all.eps}
    \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Increasing Redshift} 
\begin{itemize}
\item According to the big bang model of the universe, objects with large
redshifts are further away. 
\item Hence the results of solving the Dyer-Roeder
equation for the cases (1 and 3) when the ``clumpiness'' parameter 
$\tilde{\alpha}$ is ignored the angular diameter distance $D$ increases
as the redshift increases. 
\item In both cases we get asymptoting values:
\end{itemize} 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{z \rightarrow \infty} D_{I}(z) = 0.5
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{z \rightarrow \infty} D_{II}(z) = 0.4
\end{equation}
\end{frame} 
%In both these cases where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is not in the equation, 
%the lens is the only matter along the line of sight to the source and
%hence we get an increase in the angular diameter distance as the redshift 
%increases. Of particular interest is that in case $I$ ($\Omega = 0$), 
%the value of $D$ increases more rapidly than in case $III$ ($\Omega = 1$).
%Hence we see that the density of the universe plays influences the results
%of any models chosen for gravitational lensing. Since the mean and 
%critical densities of the universe are unknown (especially since it is
%believed that most of the matter of the universe is dark matter), 
%there are limits to how accurately we can determined parameters from
%gravitational lensing observations.

%The second case is perhaps the most interesting of the three cosmologies
%in that we have a non-zero contribution from the ``clumpiness'' parameter
%$\tilde{\alpha}$. As a result is also produces the most interesting result
%as we have a maxiumum in $D$ at $z \simeq 1$. 
%In this case where $\tilde{\alpha} = 1$, the gravitational lense
%make only a minor contribution to the total amount of smoothly distributed
%matter in the line of sight of the observer and the source. In this situation
%the matter is smootly distributed and we get gravitational lens being
%the matter between source and observer. We can then think of this
%as the light passing through a material of a different refractive index
%as in electrodynamics.

\begin{frame}{Dimming factor against source redshift}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{results/dim.eps}
    \end{center}
\end{frame} 

%Figure~\ref{fig:dimming} shows the dimming factor $(D_{II}/D_{III})^2$ plotted
%against source redshift $z$. In case $II$ has a smoothly distributed
%matter distribution meaning that we see more and brigter images than
%in case $III$ where the ``clumpiness'' parameter results in less
%light reaching the observer. As a result, a case $III$ universe appears
%to be dimmer than a case $II$ universe. The dimming ratio of factor
%is $(D_{II}/D_{III})^2$ and is plotted against red shift in the plot above.
%As we can see in the plot the higher the redshift the more dimness in
%a case $III$ universe.

%\section{Lensing an Extended Source by a Point Mass}
%    \subsection{Method}
%    A program was written to simulate the gravitational lensing 
%    of a two dimensional grid. Two make the results of the simulation
%    more interesting the two dimensional grid chosen was represented
%    as a two dimensional array of integers ranging from 0 to 255.
%    The value at each array element represents an intensity value. As a result
%    the grid represents a two dimensional Portable Grey Map (PGM) image.
%    The program was written to accept the name of a PGM file on the command
%    line, load the image into memory,, apply the gravitational lensing calculations
%    and output a new ``lensed'' PGM image to standard output. The program
%    also takes the mass $M$ (in $kg$) of the lensing body, the effective
%    distance D specified in equation~\ref{eq:effd}, and the $(x,y)$
%    location of the lensing body.
%    The details of the lensing algorithm can be found in Algorithm~\ref{alg:lense}.

\begin{frame}{Lensing Images}
    A number of different images were used in the simulation. Two were used
    for testing purposes and to observe the effect, and three were images
    of astronomical interest. The images used include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A human face
        \item The starship Enterprise
        \item The Andromeda Galaxy
        \item The Milky Way
        \item The Pleiades Star Cluster
    \end{itemize}

    %The program used for the simulation called \texttt{image.c} can
    %be found in Appendix C. The programming language used in this case
    %was C instead of FORTRAN, for the following reasons:
    %\begin{itemize}
    %    \item Using a C \texttt{struct} was appropriate in representing
    %          the data stored in a single PGM image.
    %    \item Image files of varying widths and heights were used, and 
    %          therefore the program made used of dynamic memory allocation
    %          to allocate only the memory that was required to store
    %          the images.
    %\end{itemize}

    In all cases the distance ratio used was $D = 1$ and just the mass
    was varied. This is because when calculating the Einstein radius,
    the quantity $DM$ appears as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        \theta_E = \sqrt{\frac{4GMD}{c^2}}
    \end{equation}
\end{frame} 

%\subsection{Results and Discussion}

%\subsubsection{A Human Face}
%An image of a face was used to first test the program. 
%The original image and the simulated lensing of the face is shown
%in Figure~\ref{fig:face}.  The image on the
%left is the original, and the image on the right is one that has been
%gravitationally lensed by a point mass in the lower right hand corner
%of mass, $M = 5 \times 10^{30}$ kg.

\begin{frame}{Gravitational lensing of image of a human face by a mass $M = 5 \times 10^{30}$ kg}

        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{pics/kr_5e30.eps} \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{frame} 

%Apart from the obvious distortion in the lensed image, of particular
%interest is the formation of two images, one small and one large.
%The smaller image is inside the Einstein radius of the lense.

%\subsubsection{The Enterprise}
%Figure~\ref{fig:enterprise} shows three images of the starship Enterprise
%from Star Trek. 
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item The image on the left is the original
%    \item The center image has a gravitational lense of mass
%          $M = 2 \times 10^{30}$ kg with the lense placed in the 
%          centre.
%    \item The image on the right has a gravitational lense of
%          mass $M = 1 \times 10^{31}$ in the lower right hand corner.
%\end{itemize}

%With the lense in the center of the image it is more difficult to 
%see the two images. The image on the right resulting from a larger
%mass (and with the lens in the bottom right hand corner)
%clearly shows both the images and large distortions.
%In many cases of actual observations, the images inside the Einstein radius
%are two small to be resolved by even the most powerful telescopes.

%\subsubsection{The Andromeda Galaxy}     
%%Figure~\ref{fig:andromeda} shows the effect of different masses gravitational lensing
%an image of the Andromeda galaxy.  A number different lenses
%of varying masses were used. In all the cases the lensing object
%is located in the upper left hand corner of the image [position $(0,0)$].

%As the mass of the lense is increased, the amount of distortion in the
%resulting image is increased. The secondary image is also clearly visible.

%\subsubsection{The Milky Way}
%Figure~\ref{fig:milky-way} shows the effect of simulated gravitational lensing
%on an image of the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. 
%The image on left is looking towards the centre of the Milky Way in the
%infrared. The image on the right is gravitationally lensed by a 
%$M = 3 \times 10^{30}$ kg mass. The lense is located slightly left and above
%from the center. This image of the Milky Way allows us to see the distortion
%of the image within the Einstein radius much easier.

%    which calculated critical curves and caustics for given
%    values of $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. As stated earlier, critical
%    curves are obtained when Jacobian determinant is zero ($\det A = 0$)
%    This gives:

\begin{frame}{Caustics for the Chang-Refsdal Lens} 
    \begin{equation}
        \det A = 1 - \left( \gamma + \frac{\epsilon}{\bar{z}^2} \right)
                     \left( \gamma + \frac{\epsilon}{\bar{z}^2} \right) = 0
    \end{equation}.
    Using complex polar coordinates letting $z = x \cos \phi + ix \sin \phi$
    we get
    \begin{equation}
        x^4 (1 - \gamma^2) - 2 \gamma \epsilon x^2 
            (\cos^2\phi - \sin^2\phi) - 1 = 0
    \end{equation}
    The equation can be parameterised by letting:
        \[ \lambda = \cos^2\phi - \sin^2\phi \]
        \[ u = x^2 \]
    giving
    \begin{equation}
        u^2(1 - \gamma^2) - 2\gamma \epsilon \lambda u - 1 = 0.
    \end{equation}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Caustics for the Change-Refsdal Lens (continued)} 
    Solving this quadratic we obtain:
    \begin{equation}
        u = \frac{\gamma\epsilon\lambda \pm \sqrt{\gamma^2(\lambda^2 - 1) + 1}}
                 {(1 - \gamma^2)}
    \end{equation}
    For a given values of $\gamma$, $\epsilon$ and for $0 < \phi < 2\pi$
    the program calculates $u$ and then $x$. The $(x,y)$ coordinates
    for the caustic curve is then given by $(x\cos\phi, x\sin\phi)$.
    The corresponding caustics are given by:
    \begin{equation}
        y_1 = \left[ (1 + \gamma)x - \frac{\epsilon}{x} \right] 
              \sqrt{\frac{1 + \lambda}{2} } 
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
       y_2 = \left[ (1 - \gamma)x - \frac{\epsilon}{x} \right] 
                     \sqrt{\frac{1 - \lambda}{2} }
    \end{equation}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Selecting Values for $\epsilon$ and $\gamma$} 
    In the program a value of $\epsilon = 0.5$ was chosen. Values
    of gamma were chosen for the four representative regions in which
    caustics are found. The four regions are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\gamma < -1$
        \item $-1 < \gamma < 0$
        \item $0 < \gamma < 1$
        \item $\gamma > 1$
    \end{itemize}
    The four values of $\gamma$ selected are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\gamma = -1.3$ 
        \item $\gamma = -0.4$
        \item $\gamma = +0.8$
        \item $\gamma = +1.6$
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

%    \subsection{Results}
%    The generated critical curves and caustics for the different values of $\gamma$ selected 
%    are shown in the following figures:

%    \subsection{Discussion}
%    As can be seen from the diagrams in the previouse section, 
%    the caustic curves with values of $\gamma$ ranging between
%    $-1$ and $1$ are non overlapping curves, whereas the others
%    overlap in a ``petal'' pattern.

%    The caustics can be used to determine light curves for background
%    sources since they mark where intensity increases in the resulting
%    gravitationally lensed image occur.

            \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/lens_model.eps}
        \end{center}
    \end{frame} 

%    The use of critical lines and caustics are even more important
%    when modelling graviational lenses especially when both the source
%    and the lens are more complicated objects such as galaxies.
%    For example Figure~\ref{fig:binary-star} shows the representation of 
%    gravitational lensing for a distant star by a binary star system.
%    As can be seen from the diagram, a simple point mass model is
%    not sufficient to handle a system such as this, and hence
%    more detailed models such as the Chang-Refsdal lens model
%    are needed to simulate this situation so that it we can accurate
%    comparisons with observations.
